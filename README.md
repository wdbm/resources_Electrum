# Electrum

Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet (or client). You can read its documentation [here](docs.electrum.org). *Vitally* it is open source, which means that the eyes of the security researchers of the world can assess it. You can see its source code [here](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum).

# quick start (for LineageOS/Android)

So, let's say you've received a thoughtful gift of some Bitcoin, perhaps in the form of an image like this:

Now you want to import that into your wallet! You can have a gentle, safe view of that record of what Bitcoin you are owed by importing just the public key or you can take control of that record of Bitcoin you are owed by importing the private key so that you don't just see the Bitcoin, but can spend it! Let's assume you want to import the private key.

Install Electrum. This can be done from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electrum.electrum) or from the [Yalp Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore).

When it is installed, launch Electrum...

When it starts, you have a few options. You can create wallets of various types. For this example, we are going to import the private key, so select the option appropriate for that.

Now, to import the private key, you can use a camera to scan in a QR code or you can type or paste the alphanumeric string of the key. Let's use the camera, so select the camera option.

Grant Electrum the permission to use your camera.

Let Electrum see the private key QR code and it should scan it in.

You should now see the alphanumeric string of the private key displayed, and so can go to the next step.

Choose a wee PIN code. This is to offer a little protection of someone accesses your phone without your permission.

Confirm your PIN code.

Now, your Bitcoin balance should be visible. You can change the units used (e.g. BTC, mBTC) via the settings.

You can send Bitcoins by scanning the public key of another address...

... and you can receive Bitcoins by showing the public key QR code or sharing the alphanumeric string of the public key!
